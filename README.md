# Problems

I think the management of the directory has been the biggest challenge for me. Countless occasions have occurred where I would start working on the wrong logic.js or index.html file, and then had to redo everything! Overall a pretty fun experience though coding in JavaScript or HTML, since it reminds me of my old coding days back in India.
